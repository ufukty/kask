# Pages

Since the pages and sections of Kask sites are managed as folders and files, you need to create a file in your computer to add a page to your website.

## First page

Navigate to your content folder. Create a file in it. Name the file. Filename will also be visible on the page address to your visitors.

Open the file in your Markdown editor. Edit the contents as you wish to be seen on web. Here is an example Markdown file:

```md

Save the document. Close the editor. Proceed to the next step.
