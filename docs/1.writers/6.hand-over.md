# Hand-over

When you finish writing the contents of website's next iteration, notify the developer. The developer section has instructions to generate the website.

When the collaboration gets too frequent; developer and writer might consider using a platform like GitHub, or GitLab to asynchronously work from each other. The Kask directory structure is designed to hide developer files from writer to avoid any technical confusion, thus allows working together on the same copy of content folder.
