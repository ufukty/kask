# Ordering

Kask orders pages of a section by the file names. To apply custom ordering to pages and folders, just prefix the filenames with numbers.

Kask will automatically remove the leading numbers and following punctuation from the page and section titles and links. To exclude a directory's pages from this treatment where it doesn't make sense; create a meta file in that directory named `.kask.yml` and add this line into the file content. (Don't include the line number below)

```yml
preserve-ordering: true

Figure: `.kask.yml`
