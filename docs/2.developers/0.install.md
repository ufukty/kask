# Install

To embed the version information into binary (and produced files for reproducibility):

```sh
cd "$(mktemp -d)"
git clone https://go.ufukty.com/kask
cd kask
git fetch --tags --quiet
git checkout "$(git tag --list 'v*' | sort -Vr | head -n 1)"
make install
```

Make sure you have the `make`, `git` and `go` commands accessible by your `PATH`. Users don't care about the version number stamping can as well use the `go install` command directlty.
