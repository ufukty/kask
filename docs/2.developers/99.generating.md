# Generate

Once you have enough files to create your website open your terminal. Then type this `build` command with `kask` like below. Adjust the input and output paths according to your setup, they should point to folders. Run when you are ready by pressing enter.

```sh
kask build -in content-folder -out website
```

## Generate for Workers

Kask can be configured to create page URLs in a way that the Workers platform supports, out of the box, by only passing the `-cfw` flag, as such:

```sh
kask build -in content-folder -out website -cfw
```

This will direct Kask to skip appending the `.html` extensions at the end of page URLs that will be eventually assigned to the `Href` fields of [`Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.ufukty.com/kask@v0.13.1/pkg/kask#Node) values. Thus following cross site links won't require a redirect from the Workers router. This behavior is what Workers expects when [Html handling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/advanced/html-handling/#automatic-trailing-slashes-default) is set to auto as such:

```toml
[assets]
html_handling = "auto-trailing-slash"
```

It can also be omitted in wrangler config, as the auto is the default mode.

## Troubleshooting

Kask will print error messages with the path of error point. Together they hint the actual problem and its context.

The checklist when you get errors:

- There are `"page"` templates for all Html pages.
- There are `"markdown-page"` templates for all Markdown pages.
- Page context is not misused. See [the spec](./2.html-pages.md/#templating-content).
