# Generate

Once you have enough files to create your website open your terminal. Then type this `build` command with `kask` like below. Adjust the input and output paths according to your setup, they should point to folders. Run when you are ready by pressing enter.

```sh
kask build -in content-folder -out website
```

## Troubleshooting

Kask will print error messages with the path of error point. Together they hint the actual problem and its context.

The checklist when you get errors:

- There are `"page"` templates for all Html pages.
- There are `"markdown-page"` templates for all Markdown pages.
- Page context is not misused. See [the spec](./2.html-pages.md/#templating-content).
