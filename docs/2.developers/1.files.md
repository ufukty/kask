Kask look out for templates named `"page"` and `"markdown-page"` for rendering Html and Markdown based files, respectively. The directories supposed to house declarations of such templates are `.kask`, `.kask/propagate` or `../.kask/propagate` folders for the Markdown pages. Html page templates can also be declared inside the page's file, exclusively or to override section defaults.
