# Kask

Kask is a static website builder that separates developer-responsible files away from the technical writer responsible files inside hidden `.kask` folders. This aims to provide means for collaboration without synchronization.

Please refer to documentation for more. Which is also built with kask out of markdown files and the contents of `.kask` folder at the top directory.
